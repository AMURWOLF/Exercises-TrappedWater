# Exercises-TrappedWater
Some exercises for Java coding: count trapped water

This exercises were developed for Java language.
I always find only procedural solutions for sich kind of exercises. 
Here I suggest object oriented ones with the reusable class "LithosphereSection".


## Exercise 1

There is a beach with a ground configuration like [ 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 6, 7, 2, 3, 1 ].\
A wave come from a sea to the left of the beach. Its height is 5, for example.\
Then the wave come back to the sea.\
In the beach's hollows we find trapped water.\
If the wave is higher than beach it covers the full beach and goes away to both directions.\
Task: write a programm for counting all trapped water on the whole beach.


## Exercise 2

There is an island with a ground configuration like\
[\
    [ 5, 3, 4, 5 ], \
    [ 6, 2, 1, 4 ], \
    [ 3, 1, 1, 4 ], \
    [ 8, 5, 4, 3 ] \
]\
A rain was many days. \
It filled by water every hollow in the island.\
Water can go away only to 4 directions: north, south, west, east.\
Task: write a programm for counting all trapped water in whole island.\
For example, the answer for a given configuration is 7.


## Exercises next

Think up other variations: a beach and rain; an island and waves; or something other.
